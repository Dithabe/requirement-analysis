Requirement Analysis in Software Development

In every software development project, proper requirements analysis is vital for the successful deployment of the project.
This repository serves as a layout for the requirement analysis process in a project.

<h2>What is Requirement Analysis?</h2>
<p>Requirements analysis is a crucial phase in software development lifecycle (SDLC) where the project gathers,
analyzes, and defines the requirements of the software product to be developed.</p>

<h2>Why is Requirement Analysis Important?</h2>
<p>In the SDLC process, requirements analysis is important as it:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Aids in clarity and understanding of what the stakeholder needs are</li>
  <li>Clearly defines the scope of the project, preventing scope creep</li>
  <li>Provides a solid foundation for designing and developing systems</li>
  <li>Facilitates accurate estimation of project cost, resource, and time</li>
</ul>

<h2>Key Activities in Requirement Analysis</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Requirement Gathering - using interviews, surveys, and workshops to collect initial requirements from stakeholders.</li>
  <li>Requirement Elicitation - Refining and elaborating on the gathered requirements through brainstorming, focus groups, and prototyping techniques</li>
  <li>Requirement Documentation - Using requirement specification documents, user stories, and use cases to capture the requirements in a detailed and structured format.</li>
  <li>Requirement Analysis and Modeling - Creating models to visualize and understand requirements</li>
  <li>Requirement Validation - The review and validation of the requirements with stakeholders in addition to defining the acceptance criteria to ensure traceability</li>
</ul>
